### Silhouettes ###

This is a program that searches on picture with silhouettes of people (not stuck together) 
and displays their number. When creating the program, the method of 
[breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) was used.

Picture input example:
* man.png
* people.jpeg

Note: The picture must be white, and the silhouettes are black or vice versa.
